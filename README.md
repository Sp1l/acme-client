## Synopsis

*letskencrypt* is yet another [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)
client, but one with a strong focus on security.  **It is still under
development**. 

See [kristaps.bsd.lv/letskencrypt](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/letskencrypt) for
complete documentation and stable releases.

This repository is for the [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) version and
requires OpenBSD 5.9 or greater.  For the portable version (Mac OS X,
Linux, FreeBSD, older OpenBSD) see
[letskencrypt-portable](https://github.com/kristapsdz/letskencrypt-portable).

This repository mirrors the master CVS repository: any source changes
will occur on the master and be pushed periodically to GitHub.  If you
have bug reports or patches, either file them here or e-mail them to me.
Feature requests will be ignored unless joined by a patch.
